Hello Community,

We are happy to bring you a new major release of Bacularis 7.0.0. Since
the release of version 6.0.0, many new features and improvements have
been added to the interface. We feel that now is the right time to bring
them together under a new major version and mark another important milestone
in the development of Bacularis.

Originally, we planned to release this version as 6.6.0. However, looking
at the scope of changes introduced since 6.0.0 and the pace of development
of the project, we decided that this was a good moment for the next major
release.

One of the main additions in 7.0.0 is a new checker designed to detect
signals that may indicate ransomware activity. It works as part of the Restore
Verification system. Thanks to this integration, the analysis is not based
solely on metadata or statistics. The checker examines actual data restored
from backup during a restore test.

We spent a significant amount of time testing the checker and calibrating
its measurements. It uses a multi-signal approach. Instead of relying on
a single type of analysis, it combines several different signals that may
indicate anomalies in the data. Detected anomalies are assigned weighted
scores, and the combined score determines the final verification result.

You can find all the details about this feature in the checker documentation:

https://bacularis.app/doc/restore-verification/checker-plugins/available-checkers/ransomware-detection.html

While developing the ransomware checker, we also introduced two mechanisms
that may be useful for developers creating their own Restore Verification
checkers in Bacularis. The first provides support for checker configurations,
while the second makes it possible to maintain a history of previous checker
results.

Both mechanisms are described in detail in the documentation, in the chapter
about creating checkers. They are generic mechanisms and can also be used by
other checkers. In the ransomware checker, they made it possible to compare
historical results with current changes in backup data and determine whether
observed deviations represent an anomaly or typical behavior for a given
dataset.

In addition to the new features, Bacularis 7.0.0 also includes a number
of fixes.

If we look at 7.0.0 as the next major release after 6.0.0, the list of new
capabilities has become quite extensive. Some of the most important changes
introduced since 6.0.0 include:

- Restore Verification
- Ransomware detection
- Simple restore
- AWS EC2 backup plugin
- Global search
- New look and feel

Bacularis 7.0.0 packages are available in all package repositories provided
by Bacularis. Users of other installation methods, including Docker container
images and PHP Composer, can also update their instances to the new version.

We wish you smooth and successful upgrades. Thank you for every contribution,
every piece of feedback, and every form of support for the project.
We truly appreciate it.

We hope Bacularis 7.0.0 serves you well.
