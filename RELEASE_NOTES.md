This is a new feature and bug fix release. We added capability to set read-only,
read-write and no access permissions per Bacula configuration resource for
users, hosts and host groups. It makes Bacularis granular permission control
even more powerful and attractive.

Changes:
 - Add Bacula resource permission settings
